# Red and Blue America: The Political Divide at the State Level

This is for my visualization of the political divide at the state legislature level.  In it, I explore which parties are in control of each state legislative district to provide a more granular view of where "red" and "blue" America exists.  I do this in two parts:
- maps that stitch together all of the legislative districts for each state (1 map for upper houses, 1 map for lower houses)
- force layouts that show the breakdown in political control for each state (1 layout for upper houses, 1 layout for lower houses)
